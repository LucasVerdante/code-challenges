# Company XYZ Frontend Challenge

## Challenge Description

Company XYZ's mission is to provide freight forwarders with easy to understand and beautiful workflow and analytics tools in order to help them run their businesses more efficiently. The freight forwarding industry has been largely underserved when it comes to technology and what tools do exist do not place a strong emphasis on usability, design and easy information consumption. A lot of the day-to-day workflows are handled via email, SMS, WhatsApp and phone calls largely because the existing tools in the market have not prioritized user experience.

One of the key parts of the freight forwarding operation is understanding where shipments are for each of their customers so that they can proactively notify their customers on the status of their shipments and also proactively get in touch with their customers in case there is a delay. Having knowledge of when shipments are going to arrive is also critical for the customers of forwarders since they use that information to plan how their businesses are going to be run.

For this challenge, we are asking you to create a simple web application that will let a freight forwarder see where shipments are in the world. You will start with a data file that lists each shipment and has the following data for each shipment:

* Shipment ID
* Client name
* Origin address
* Destination address
* Mode of transport
* ETD (estimated time of departure from the origin)
* ETA (estimated time of arrival)
* Status

You will have creative freedom on how you want to present the information and what framework you want to build this in but keep the following things in mind:

* There is tremendous value in seeing all the shipments in an aggregate view
* User experience and concise information presentation will be important in order to encourage adoption
* Even if the web app loses connectivity, it should still be able to function in some capacity

A good starting point is TodoMVC (http://todomvc.com).

As a bonus, in addition to displaying the existing shipments, add support for the forwarder to insert more shipments into the list.

When you're on-site, we will review the final deliverable along with having you walk us through your thought process and how you achieved the end result. Prior to coming on-site, please send us a link to the repository that has the sample application.

We hope this is a fun project and please let us know if you have any questions.
